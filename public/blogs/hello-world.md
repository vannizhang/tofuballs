## Hello World

I've always felt that I should have a personal technical blog, but I have been procrastinating and delaying taking action.

One of the main reasons for my procrastination is that I don't feel very good at writing, especially in English, so I always feel that writing a blog in English would be a burden.

However, I recently discovered that ChatGPT is a very useful tool that can help me improve my grammar and wording, so I can focus on the content I want to write rather than the grammar itself, making writing a blog a much easier task.

So, I've added the functionality of a blog here, and plan to come back from time to time to update and share some technical content.
