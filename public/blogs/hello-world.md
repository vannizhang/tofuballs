## Hello World

总觉得应该要有一个个人技术博客，但是却一直拖延，迟迟没有行动。

拖延的一个主要原因是因为我觉得自己不是很擅长写作，尤其是用英文，所以总觉得用英文写博客会是个负担。

但是最近发现chatgtp是个很好用的工具，能够很好的帮我修改语法跟措辞，这样我便只需要专注于想要写的内容，而不是语法本身，从而使得写博客变成了一件轻松的事情。

于是便在这里加上这个博客的功能，打算以后时不时上来更新一下，用来记录跟分享一些跟技术相关的内容。

I've always felt that I should have a personal technical blog, but I have been procrastinating and delaying taking action.

One of the main reasons for my procrastination is that I don't feel very good at writing, especially in English, so I always feel that writing a blog in English would be a burden.

However, I recently discovered that ChatGPT is a very useful tool that can help me improve my grammar and wording, so I can focus on the content I want to write rather than the grammar itself, making writing a blog a much easier task.

So, I've added the functionality of a blog here, and plan to come back from time to time to update and share some technical content.
