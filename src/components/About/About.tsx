            <p>Hi, I'm Jinnan, a web developer based in Redlands, CA. At Esri, I lead the front-end development of the <a href='https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/home/' target='_blank'>Living Atlas</a> team, I also build <a href='https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/apps/' target='_blank'>apps</a> using contents on Living Atlas along with other Esri technologies.</p>

            <p>I enjoy solving problems (either building a front-end app or writing a script to automate something) by breaking it into smaller parts first. I also enjoy spending time on learning and practicing good ways to write clean, maintainable and reusable codes, to make future me's life easier.</p>

            <p>I am currently monkeying with the MERN Stack just for fun. I am also learning/exploring different ways to optimize the front-end performance.</p>
