            <p>Hello, I'm Jinnan, a front-end developer based in Redlands, CA. At Esri, I lead the front-end development of the <a href='https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/home/' target='_blank'>Living Atlas</a> team and build apps using contents on Living Atlas along with other Esri technologies.</p>

            <p>I enjoy solving problems by breaking them down into smaller parts, whether it's building a front-end app or writing a script to automate a task. I also enjoy spending time learning and practicing ways to write clean, maintainable, and reusable code that makes life easier for my future self.</p>

            <p>Currently, I'm having fun experimenting with the MERN stack and exploring different ways to optimize front-end performance.</p>
