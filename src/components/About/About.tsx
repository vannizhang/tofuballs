                I enjoy solving problems by breaking them down into smaller
                parts, whether it&#39;s building a front-end app or writing a
                script to automate a task. I also enjoy spending time learning
                and practicing ways to write clean, maintainable, and reusable
                code that makes life easier for my future self.
            </p>

            <p>
                Currently, I&#39;m having fun experimenting with the MERN stack
                and exploring different ways to optimize front-end performance.
